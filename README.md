Bugs:
- Editing any individual is going to be very difficult, since they include all of their relatives as objects, rather than as xrefs only. This means that if we change any individual, we need to invalidate all of them.

Thoughts:

- The gedcom objects should be able to be edited, and generate new gedcom.
- Consider using shoelace instead of bootstrap.
